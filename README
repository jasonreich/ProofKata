Over the last three years, I've played with more theorem provers than
I can actually remember. As I redescover small examples, I shall put
them up here for posterity.

Included problems;
* Hutton's arithmetic compiler.

Still hunting for;
* McCarthy-Painter compiler example.
* Proofs from a mini-tutorial I gave.
