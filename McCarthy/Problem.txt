Problem: McCarthy and Painter
=============================

Taken from McCarthy and Painter (1966) Correctness of a compiler for arithmetic
expressions.

* Define a source language that describe simple arithmetic instructions
on natural numbers, with variables. E.g.

  (1 + (2 + y) + 4) + x

* Define an evaluator for the source language.

* Define a target language that describes an register machine.

  li 1; stor t0; li 2; stor t1; load x; add t1; add t0; stor t0; li 4;
  add t0; sto t0; load x; sto t0;

* Define the compiler from source to target.

* Demonstrate the correctness of this compiler.

Solutions given in Agda, Coq and Isabelle/HOL.
