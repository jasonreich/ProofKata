Problem: Hutton
===============

Taken from Graham Hutton's Programming with Haskell.

* Define a source language that describe simple arithmetic instructions
on natural numbers. E.g.

  (1 + (2 + 3) + 4) + 5

* Define an evaluator for the source language.

* Define a target language that describes a stack machine that can
sum the top two elements on the stack. E.g.

  push 1; push 2; push 3; sum; sum; push 4; sum; push 5; sum

* Define the compiler from source to target.

* Demonstrate the correctness of this compiler.

Solutions given in Agda and Coq.
